        How I Got Into This Field
      </h2>

        My journey into data and analytics started with a strong curiosity about
        how decisions are driven by data. During my academic projects, I
        explored Python and SQL, which led me to build small insights dashboards
        and automate data pipelines. Interning at S.O Infotech gave me
        real-world exposure to Power BI, web scraping with Selenium, and even
        building a face recognition system using OpenCV. These hands-on
        experiences solidified my interest in the field and motivated me to
        pursue data analytics as a career.
